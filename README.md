# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR

Introduction:
The main purpose of this project is to simplify the process of extracting information from business cards using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The application allows users to upload an image of a business card and automatically extract relevant information such as company name, cardholder name, designation, contact details, and address.

Technologies Used:
OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Streamlit (for creating the graphical user interface)
SQL (for database management)
Data Extraction techniques

Approach:
Install Required Packages: Install Python, Streamlit, OCR library (e.g., easyOCR), and a suitable database management system.

Design User Interface: Create a user interface using Streamlit, incorporating features such as file uploaders, buttons, and text boxes to guide users through the extraction process.

Implement OCR: Utilize OCR techniques to extract relevant information from the uploaded business card image. Employ image processing methods if necessary to enhance OCR accuracy.

Display Extracted Information: Present the extracted information in a clear and organized manner within the Streamlit GUI, using widgets like tables and text boxes.

Database Integration: Integrate a database management system (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) to store the extracted information alongside the uploaded business card image. Implement functionalities to add, update, and delete data through the Streamlit UI.

Testing: Thoroughly test the application to ensure proper functionality. Run the application locally using the command streamlit run app.py and perform various tests to validate its performance.

Continuous Improvement: Continuously enhance the application by adding new features, optimizing code, and addressing any bugs or issues. Consider implementing user authentication and authorization for enhanced security.

Results:
BizCardX delivers a streamlined solution for extracting and managing business card information. Users can effortlessly upload business card images, extract relevant details using OCR, and store the information in a database. The application boasts a simple yet effective user interface, making it accessible to both businesses and individuals. With its emphasis on scalability, maintainability, and extensibility, BizCardX is poised to become an indispensable tool for efficiently managing business card data.
